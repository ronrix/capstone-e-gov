                Renewable energy is becoming more popular in the Philippines. 
                As an alternative source of power and electricity, wind energy produces no waste 
                and it is beneficial both for the people and the environment. It was in 2008 when 
                the Department of Energy granted permission to Alternergy in creating a wind farm 
                in the mountain slopes of Pililla, Rizal. Its purpose is to serve the nearby towns 
                and municipalities of Rizal and Laguna with clean source of energy.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">
                The construction of the windmills began by 2013, and the project were finished three 
                years after. The rise of Pililla Wind Farm provides not just electricity, but also a 
                boost in tourism in the municipality. The place became viral across social media, and 
                until today, many travelers visit this place to have a personal encounter with these 
                gigantic wind turbines.
